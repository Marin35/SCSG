# Implementation of Stochastically Controlled Stochastic Gradient Method
*Authors : Marin BOUTHEMY & Kossi NEROMA*


This code is an implementation of the Stochastically Controlled Stochastic Gradient Method (SCSG) algorithm designed by [Lihua Lei & al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.09156).

We have implemented it and test it with a convex and a non-convex problem.
